## Heart Disease Prediction Machine Learning Project
This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on a set of input variables.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, which contains 303 instances and 14 attributes. The dataset is available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and can also be accessed through the Kaggle website.

# Tools Used
This project uses the following tools and libraries:

* pandas
* scikit-learn
* numpy
* seaborn
# How to Run the Code
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure that you have the required libraries installed (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy).
Navigate to the root directory of the project and run python main.py.
The program will output the results of the machine learning algorithm.
Results
The machine learning algorithm achieved an accuracy of X% in predicting heart disease. This result demonstrates the potential of using machine learning algorithms to predict medical conditions based on a set of input variables.

# Further Work
There are several avenues for further work on this project. Some possibilities include:

Exploring different machine learning algorithms and comparing their performance.
Optimizing the parameters of the current machine learning algorithm.
Adding additional input variables to the dataset to see if the accuracy of the machine learning algorithm can be improved.
